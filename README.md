# CuteSimpleRestClient

Simple Rest Api Client Library for C++/Qt Applications.
The Library is a wrapper of a few QtNetworkAuth Classes, and the wrapper are somewhat more user friendly although more limited than the QtnetworkAUth classes
The Main Class is the "RestApiManager", which has get, post, put, delete methods and can be used from Qml directly as well

The responseReady signal is fired as soon as a response to a query is received.


This library is very useful and easy to use, but keep in mind that this is a POC and is definitely NOT production ready.

Any Contribution would be HIGHLY appreciated :)
